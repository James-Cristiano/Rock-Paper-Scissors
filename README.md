# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Text version of the game

## Description
This program will keep track of your Wins/Losses/Ties and even Points! You can then play against the computer for your chance to start earning points.
After you earn some, the game will allow you to double down and try again, if you win you can get 2x the points otherwise so goodbye to all of them!
The game will then repeat and stops once you decide to quit it.
